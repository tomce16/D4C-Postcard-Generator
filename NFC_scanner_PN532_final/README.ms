              Eindhoven Musuem Scanner code
 
    Some parts of the code are taken from Adafruit example codes.

    This code reads the token (NFC chip) using the Arduino and PN532 boards,
    writes data to it and sends the data to plugged in computer via serial port.
    In addition, when LED strip is plugged in, scanner will show current working
    status via LEDs.
